TODOs:
  - CRITICAL: |
      Ensure that all controller loop instances disallow concurrent runs.

      In other words, the control loop can only be started when it's not
      already running.

  - Check if not already done: |
      Document the different kinds of notification pathways b/w loadbalancer.

      I.e. the fast "autocrine/paracrine" UDP pathway, and the slower but
      regulated "endocrine" WAL-based pathway.

  - Implement internal/adapter/cluster.
  - Implement internal/adapter/monitor.
  - Implement internal/adapter/wal.
  - Implement internal/controller/dvds.
